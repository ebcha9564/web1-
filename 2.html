  <h2>W SKILL</h2>
  <h3>DESCRIPTION:</h3>
  <p>Akali restores energy and creates a cloud of smoke, which slowly spreads to cover a ring-shaped area. While in the smoke, Akali is obscured and has increased movement speed.
    While obscured, Akali is stealthed and though her position can be revealed, Akali herself can't beâ€”meaning she can't be targeted by abilities or attacks, including by turrets.
    Akali can leave the smoke a few times to extend the duration of Twilight Shroud by a small amount</p>
